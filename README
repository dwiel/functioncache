functioncache

functioncache is a decorator which saves the return value of functions even
after the interpreter dies. For example this is useful on functions that download
and parse webpages. All you need to do is specify how long
the return values should be cached (use seconds, like time.sleep).

USAGE:

    from functioncache import functioncache
    
    @functioncache(24 * 60 * 60)
    def time_consuming_function(args):
        # etc
    
    @functioncache(functioncache.YEAR)
    def another_function(args):
        # etc


NOTE: All arguments of the decorated function and the return value need to be
    picklable for this to work.

NOTE: The cache isn't automatically cleaned, it is only overwritten. If your
    function can receive many different arguments that rarely repeat, your
    cache may forever grow. One day I might add a feature that once in every
    100 calls scans the db for outdated stuff and erases.

NOTE: This is less useful on methods of a class because the instance (self)
    is cached, and if the instance isn't the same, the cache isn't used. This
    makes sense because class methods are affected by changes in whatever
    is attached to self.

Tested on python 2.7 and 3.1

A trick to invalidate a single value:

    @functioncache.functioncache
    def somefunc(x, y, z):
        return x * y * z
        
    del somefunc._db[functioncache._args_key(somefunc, (1,2,3), {})]
    # or just iterate of somefunc._db (it's a shelve, like a dict) to find the right key.
